Presentation Slides: Project 1 Aircraft Wildlife Strikes, 1990-2015.pdf


## Findings:

What bird species cause the most damage to airplanes?
What airplanes do these wildlife strikes happen the most often to?
How has the number of incidents changed over time?


- Large portion of the data is listed simply as "unknown" be it unknown bird species, unknown aircraft, unknown operator, or unknown airport.
- Unknown medium and small bird species make up the most of the wildlife strikes. Mourning doves, gulls, and killdeers are the top 3 of the listed species involved in incidents.
- B-737-300, B-737-700, A-320 are the 3 listed aircrafts are involved in the most incidents.
- Business operators were the highest listed followed closely by Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines.
- Denver International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth Internation Airport, and Chicago O'Hare International Airport where the top 3 airports listed with the highest rate of incidents.
- The vast majority of wildlife strikes resulted in no flight impact (88.55%). It was then followed by Precautionary Landing (6.18%), Other (2.43%), Aborted Takeoff (2.36%), and Engine Shutdown (0.46%).
- The preciptation and visibilty at the time of each incident was also recorded. It would be interesting to note whether those have any correlation with flight impact of wildlife strike.
